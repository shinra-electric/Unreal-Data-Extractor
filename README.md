# Unreal and Unreal Tournament Data Extractor
Script for extracting game data for Unreal and Unreal Tournament '99 for macOS

[OldUnreal](https://github.com/OldUnreal) has been maintaining Unreal and Unreal Tournament for many years, with the help of Epic Games. But they do not have permission to provide the game data directly. 

Since the game data is currently not available for purchase, Epic have stated that they are ok with certain ISOs on [Archive.org](https://archive.org) from which the user can extract the data themselves.

This script automates the data download and extraction process. It also handles texture data conversion that is required for Unreal Tournament. It should be run from the same folder as the app bundle.

The app bundles can be obtained from OldUnreal's GitHub page, or [Mac Source Ports](https://www.macsourceports.com)

> [!NOTE] 
> If the game data becomes available to purchase at some point in the future, that would be the preferred way to aquire it.
